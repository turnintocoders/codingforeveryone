# Coding for everyone

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone](https://badges.gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone.svg)](https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Free peer led coding sessions for everyone.

We'll be working together on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [CodeWars](http://codewars.com/) depending on your skills.

The events are managed via [this Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/)

## Meeting structure

There's no formal end of the proposed material, so you are not expected to finish anything. If you finish the FreeCodeCamp suggested materials and you start on Codewars, there's really no end to that. Katas are designed to be an infinite training, getting more complex with experience. So you can train no matter what your current level is, you'll always find something challenging there, and get better!

- Introductions
- Form homogenous pairs
- Small tutorial of the meeting
  - Register on [FreeCodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)
    - Follow the "Responsive Web Design Certification" and then carry on with some "JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification"
  - Or register on [Codewars](http://codewars.com/)
    - Complete some kata in JavaScript
    - Create some kata

## Post meeting

Keep coding on your own and feel free to participate in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone). If you ever get stuck, please ask!

If you have attended the Meetup, can you please fill out the feedback form in [English](https://goo.gl/forms/5AcnjIkuH9FBQj862) or [Italian](https://goo.gl/forms/gncZOvVdLgKueIqI3)? Thanks, you are very helpful to improve what we are doing!

## Coding bootcamp

After a couple of meetings you might have understood that you want to start a career in coding. Good! Maybe [Turn into Coders](http://turnintocoders.it/)' intensive bootcamp is the right choice for you. Get in touch!
